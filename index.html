                                    pollution. By promoting sustainable practices, Luminex Solutions contributes 
                                    to environmental preservation and helps clients meet their sustainability goals.

                                    Clients can expect substantial cost savings and energy reductions 
                                    upon transitioning to LED lighting systems. On average, we anticipate 
                                    a 30-50% reduction in energy consumption and a 20-30% decrease in 
                                    maintenance expenses annually. The ROI for LED conversions typically 
                                    ranges from 2 to 5 years, depending on factors such as facility size, 
                                    usage patterns, and local utility rates.
